# User Experience (UX) Design Overview

### Introduction

The *Better Billing* project was developed with a strong emphasis on user experience (UX), ensuring that the interface is intuitive, efficient, and suited to the needs of legal and financial professionals. This section evaluates how UX principles were applied throughout the design and development process, from initial layout considerations to testing and refinement.

**Applying Core UX Principles**

The project followed recognised UX principles such as clarity, consistency, feedback, and accessibility. Each interface component was designed to reduce cognitive load and provide a seamless workflow for users entering, reviewing, and managing billing data. Consistent button placement, typography, and spacing were achieved through the use of the Bootstrap framework, which ensured design harmony across all pages.

**Use of Bootstrap and Custom CSS**

Bootstrap provided a strong foundation for responsive design, ensuring compatibility across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Custom CSS was added to enhance branding and tailor the visual hierarchy—using colour accents, card components, and subtle shadows to distinguish sections and guide user attention. The combination of Bootstrap’s grid system and custom styling promoted both efficiency and aesthetic appeal.

**Information Architecture and Navigation**

The interface was structured around a clear and predictable navigation model. Users can easily move between clients, matters, time entries, and invoices without confusion. Each page follows a logical hierarchy with consistent placement of navigation elements, form inputs, and buttons. Breadcrumbs and headers provide contextual cues that help users understand where they are within the system.

**Feedback and Validation**

User feedback mechanisms were built into key workflows. For example, when invoices are created or time entries are submitted, Bootstrap-styled alert messages confirm the success or failure of an action. Validation errors are displayed inline, using clear language and accessible colours to ensure users can correct mistakes quickly. This reinforces the UX principle of *visibility of system status*.

**Accessibility and Readability**

Accessibility was a key design consideration. The application maintains high colour contrast ratios, legible typography, and large interactive targets to support usability for all users. Semantic HTML tags and ARIA attributes were used where appropriate to improve screen reader compatibility and ensure compliance with accessibility best practices.

**Testing and Iterative Improvement**

The interface was demoed to family members to gather initial feedback on usability, clarity, and flow. Their observations helped identify minor improvements such as spacing adjustments and button alignment refinements. This informal user testing process demonstrated an iterative approach to UX—using real feedback to refine and enhance the design. Further testing with classmates could provide additional perspectives and help validate the user journey in varied contexts.

**Conclusion**
 
By integrating UX principles throughout the development process, *Better Billing* delivers a professional, user-friendly, and accessible platform. Every design decision—from layout and typography to feedback mechanisms—was informed by the goal of simplifying complex billing processes while maintaining a polished, trustworthy aesthetic appropriate for a legal and financial environment.
